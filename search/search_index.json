This project explores diffusion by implementing both image and text models in parallel, creating a clear conceptual foundation through comparison.</p> <p>By seeing how the same mathematical principles apply to pixels and embeddings, the core ideas of forward/reverse diffusion, noise scheduling, and denoising become much clearer. The image implementation serves as an intuitive baseline, while the text experiments push into less explored territory.</p> <p>This project has also become an unexpected exercise in how AI can enhance the research process itself. I started using claude code extensively after the first <code>hello-world</code> implementations. I use it for much more than just coding - it helps me with ML Ops, tracking experiments, writing up findings, conducting literature reviews and exploring new ideas. I hope to write up these meta-observations about AI-assisted research workflows. I think the fact that I'm not a \"real\" researcher at a lab might give me an interesting perspective here.
